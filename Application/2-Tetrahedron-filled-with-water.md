#Tetrahedron filled with water.
You have the implement a function with the following signature: `tetrahedron_filled(tetrahedrons, whater)`.
- The argument tetrahedrons is list of intages. Each is edge length of a Regular tetrahedron
- Tha argument whater is an intager. It is the amount of whater that we have in liters.
- The function should return a intager.

`tetrahedron_filled(tetrahedrons, whater)`.It should returan the maximum number of tetrahedrons that can be field with `whater` liters of whater.

You can use any language you know.
You can use the previus function.

Examples:
```
>>> tetrahedron_filled([100, 20, 30], 10)
2
```

You can fill only 2 ot this Regular tetrahedrons with 10 liters of whater. First you are going to fill the second than the third tetrahedron. With the total amount of ~ 4 liters. You won't have whater to fill the first tetrahedron.
